Rules of traditional ludo game:-
1. In the traditional ludo game the token(goti) moves out from the house when the dice indicates 6. However in this ludo the token is out of the house when the dice indicates one or six.
2. Whenever we get a six we get an additional chance.
3. There are stops where if the token rests will not attack opponent's tokens. However such stops have not yet been added
4. The game can be played among 2-4 player(s) <inclusive>
5. The player whose secures all 4 tokens by reaching the centre (the win area) of the board wins the game.
  
Things yet to be implemented:-
1. Stop signs
2. Victory indication
3. Proper token attack
